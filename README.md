# discord-x86
A discord webhook written in x86_64 assembly.

Very incomplete, infact it barely has anything to do with discord at the moment, I've just got a get request working on cloudflare's website as a test.

I am currently trying to implement a dns query.

This repository will be very messy as I am quite new to github, apologies for this.
